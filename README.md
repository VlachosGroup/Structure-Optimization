# Catalyst-Structure

Catalyst structure optimization in Python. Sphinx documentation is contained in the docs folder.
It is applied to 
- NH3 decomposition on NiPt
- Oxygen reduction reaction on Pt and Au

### Dependencies

[Atomic simualtion environment](https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/) : Data structures for molecular structures anf file IO.
[NetworkX](http://networkx.github.io/index.html) : Handles graph theroy tasks such as node attributes and subgraph isomorphisms.
[Zacros-Wrapper](https://github.com/VlachosGroup/Zacros-Wrapper) : Used to build the lattice and run KMC simulations for NH3 decomposition.
